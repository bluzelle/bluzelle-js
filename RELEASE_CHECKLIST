1. Make sure tests are passing `yarn test-node`/`yarn test-browser`.

Note: TRAVIS ONLY TESTS NODE, NOT BROWSER. YOU MUST VERIFY `yarn test-browser` YOURSELF.

2. Update major/minor versions in package.json & .travis.yml. (the package.json will be overwritten by the travis deploy script, but it's good to have it set in the repo anyways)

3. Push to Travis-CI on branch master.

Note: Travis will automatically update the package version to match the major, minor, and patch version. The patch version always corresponds to the travis build number. 

4. Verify that the NPM package has been published successfully.
